# Useful links regarding basic CS concepts, SRE/DevOps approaches, Linux basics and more

## About project
This project started as a private repository of knowledge (aka knowledgebase) with materials, links, videos, and interactive software which I used to learn to prepare for the position of a junior DevOps engineer. I decided to make this repository public due to frequent questions I received on Linkedin and private channels :) about how I prepared and took the position of DevOps. I hope that it will help people who want to progress and learn. 
The repository contains only materials available **free of charge** so you can easily benefit from it. I'm aware there is a ton of great budget boot camps and online platforms you can choose from like udemy, Pluralsight (which I also used for study), etc. the basic principle that I have adopted (and I believe that it greatly helps to consolidate knowledge in general) is to use multiple sources/courses relating to the same or similar areas/issues. This way you will also avoid multiplying costs by taking more than one paid material for more than one technology/concept. 
Without prolonging, I invite you to familiarize yourself and enjoy the content below hope it will benefit your learning process!
